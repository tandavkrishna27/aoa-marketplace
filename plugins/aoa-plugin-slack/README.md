Slack Chat OS plugin for [AoA (Army of Agents)](https://github.com/meteoritelabs/aoa). Turns Slack into a bidirectional agent command center - notifications, approvals, multi-agent threads, voice-to-task pipelines, custom workflow commands, and proactive agent suggestions.

Built on the AoA plugin SDK and the domain event bridge ([PR #909](https://github.com/meteoritelabs/aoa/pull/909)).

## Why this exists

Multiple AoA users asked for notifications on the same day the plugin system shipped (2026-03-14):

> "is there a way to have codex/claude check AoA to see when tasks are done without me prompting it?" - @Choose Liberty, Discord #dev

> "basically to have it 'let me know when its done'" - @Choose Liberty, Discord #dev

> "can claude code check AoA to see when tasks are done" - @Nascozz, Discord #dev

@dotta (maintainer) responded: "we're also adding issue-changed hooks for plugins so when that lands someone could [make notifications]." The event bridge ([PR #909](https://github.com/meteoritelabs/aoa/pull/909)) shipped that same day. @dotta also asked for "someone to make a plugin that's a totally separate package" to validate the DX. @Ryze said "Really excited by the plugins. I had developed a custom plugin bridge that I will now deprecate and migrate over to the new supported plugin system."

This is that plugin.

## What it does

### Phase 1: Notifications + HITL Escalation

**Notifications (rich Block Kit formatting)**
- **Issue created** - Title, description snippet, status, priority, assignee, project fields, and a "View Issue" button
- **Issue done** - Completion confirmation with status fields and view button
- **Approval requested** - Interactive **Approve**, **Reject**, and **View** buttons. Click to act without leaving Slack.
- **Agent error** - Error message in a code block with warning indicator
- **Agent online** - Connection confirmation with check mark
- **Budget threshold** - Alerts at 80%, 90%, and 100% budget usage (deduped per threshold)
- **Onboarding milestone** - Celebrates an agent's first successful run

**Interactive approvals**
- Approve/reject buttons on every approval notification
- Clicking a button calls the AoA API and updates the Slack message inline
- Identifies which Slack user acted (logged as `slack:{user_id}`)

**HITL escalation**
- Agents that get stuck can escalate to a dedicated Slack channel with full conversation context
- Rich Block Kit formatting with conversation history, agent reasoning, and confidence score
- "Use Suggested Reply" button when the agent has a best-guess response
- "Reply to Customer", "Override Agent", and "Dismiss" buttons
- Configurable timeout (default 15 min) with automatic default action (defer, close, retry)
- Customer messages queued during escalation and delivered with the human's response
- Exposes `escalate_to_human` tool for agents

**Per-type channel routing**
- Route approvals, errors, and pipeline events to separate Slack channels
- Falls back to the default channel when a per-type channel isn't configured
- Per-company overrides still take priority

**Daily digest**
- Scheduled job (9am daily) with real stats from the AoA API
- Tasks completed, tasks created, active agents, total cost, and top performer
- Cost data accumulated from `cost_event.created` events throughout the day

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Group Threads

- **Multiple agents per thread** - Spawn up to `maxAgentsPerThread` (default 5) agents in a single Slack thread via `/clip acp spawn <agent> [display_name]`
- **@mention routing** - @mention an agent name to direct your message to a specific agent; falls back to reply-to context, then most recently active
- **Agent handoff** - `handoff_to_agent` tool lets one agent request a handoff to another with Approve/Reject buttons in-thread
- **Discussion loops** - `discuss_with_agent` tool starts a back-and-forth conversation between two agents with configurable max turns
- **Human checkpoints** - Discussion pauses every 5 turns with Continue/Stop buttons so humans stay in the loop
- **Stale detection** - Discussions auto-pause after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Output sequencing** - When multiple agents are active, outputs are queued and delivered in order with agent name labels
- **Session registry** - Tracks active/closed sessions per thread with native SDK sessions (preferred) and ACP fallback
- `/clip acp status` - Show all active agents in the current thread
- `/clip acp close [name]` - Close a specific agent or the most recently active one

### Phase 3: Media-to-Task Pipeline

- **Auto-detect media files** - Audio (mp3, m4a, ogg, wav, webm, flac) and video (mp4, webm, quicktime) attachments in threads are automatically processed
- **Whisper transcription** - Audio files are sent to a `whisper-transcriber` agent for speech-to-text
- **Brief Agent** - Optional agent summarizes the transcription into an actionable brief
- **Inline results** - Transcription and brief run IDs posted back to the original thread
- **`process_media` tool** - Agents can programmatically trigger media processing with an optional `briefAgentId`
- **Slack Events API** - `file_shared` events trigger the pipeline automatically

### Phase 4: Custom Workflow Commands

- **`!command` syntax** - Type `!deploy staging` or `!triage bug-123` in any thread to trigger registered workflows
- **Multi-step workflows** - Each command runs a sequence of steps: `invoke_agent`, `post_message`, `create_issue`, `wait_approval`
- **Argument interpolation** - Use `$1`, `$2`, or `$args` in step templates to pass user arguments
- **`register_command` tool** - Agents or admins can register new commands at runtime
- **Step-level approval gates** - `wait_approval` steps pause execution with Approve/Reject buttons
- **Progress indicators** - Each step posts status to the thread; failures show error details
- `/clip commands` - List all registered custom commands with descriptions and usage

### Phase 5: Proactive Agent Suggestions

- **Event watches** - `register_watch` tool sets up a trigger: when an event matching a pattern fires, an agent is invoked with a templated prompt
- **Wildcard patterns** - Match exact events (`issue.created`) or wildcards (`agent.run.*`)
- **Prompt interpolation** - Use `${event.payload.key}` in watch prompts to inject event data
- **Built-in sales templates** - 5 pre-built watch templates: `new-lead-follow-up`, `deal-stalled`, `high-value-issue`, `budget-warning`, `agent-error-diagnosis`
- **`list_watch_templates` tool** - Browse available templates
- **`remove_watch` tool** - Remove watches by ID
- **Scheduled check job** - Watches are evaluated periodically against buffered events (last 100 per company)
- `/clip watches` - List all active watches with trigger counts

### Slash commands

- `/clip status` - Show active agents and recent completions
- `/clip agents` - List all agents with status badges
- `/clip issues [open|done]` - List issues filtered by status
- `/clip approve <id>` - Approve a pending approval
- `/clip acp spawn <agent> [display]` - Add an agent to this thread
- `/clip acp status` - Show all agents in this thread
- `/clip acp close [name]` - Close a specific agent (or most recent)
- `/clip commands` - List registered custom commands
- `/clip watches` - List active event watches
- `/clip help` - Show this help message

## Install

```bash
npm install aoa-plugin-slack

| `remove_watch` | 5 | Remove a registered event watch |
| `list_watch_templates` | 5 | List built-in watch templates for common use cases |

## Migration

### v2.0.1

The `slackTokenRef` field now declares `format: "secret-ref"`, which is required for AoA to collect and resolve secret references at activation time. Previously, the field was a plain `string` with no format annotation, causing plugin activation to fail with `Invalid secret reference`.

**If you installed v2.0.0:** you must re-configure the plugin. Go to **Settings -> Secrets**, create a secret with your Slack Bot OAuth Token, and paste the resulting secret UUID into the `slackTokenRef` field in the plugin configuration. Raw token strings are no longer accepted in this field.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

97 tests covering notifications, approvals, escalation, session registry, media pipeline, custom commands, proactive suggestions, Block Kit formatting, and slash commands.
